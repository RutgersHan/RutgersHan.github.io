1. Use CNN and the localization technique to iteratively localize the object. Few and more accurate region proposal.

2. localize attributes

3. Use biological intuition to design temporal CNN

4. use temporal CNN and usual CNN to do more vision tasks (eg.motion segmentation). What data is to train the temporal CNN should be considered(may be see the unsupervised CNN)
